# DHSHarmonization 0.0.0.9002 (2025-10-28)

- Updated `list_raw_flat_dhs` and `list_raw_gps_dhs` functions to accept a `file_list` argument for better flexibility.
- Removed the deprecated `list_raw_flat_mis` function and its associated tests.
- Enhanced documentation for `list_raw_flat_dhs`, `list_raw_gps_dhs`, and `list_raw_gps_covars` to reflect new usage patterns.
- Updated vignettes to demonstrate the new function signatures and provide clearer examples for users.
- Added error handling in the data merging process for better robustness.
