<p>Here we demonstrate how to load and view the DHS datasets that will be harmonized in this package. Each section builds the function needed to read in the data, and then tests it to ensure it works as expected. The functions are then implemented in the targets pipeline.</p>
<p>Some basic EDA is provided for you to help you understand what data can be made available to you through a data request.</p>

<p>So long as the data has a flat structure, it should be straightforward to load it into R and view it using the <code>rdhs</code> package. The structure is taken from this <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm#CP_JUMP_10334" class="external-link">DHS page</a>.</p>

To give an example of how distribution files for a survey are organized, the following table shows the available files, along with the names that they are given for the Kenya 2003 DHS survey.

<p>So, for the generic ones, we know that we have BR (Birth rates), HR (Household), HW (height and weight), IR (individual), KR (kids), PR (household member), and SQ (Service Availability). We also have WI (wealth), CR (couples), MR (men’s), GE (Geographic Data), GC (geospatial covariates), FW (Fieldworker), and MIS data (malaria response survey).</p>
<p>To read in the generic flat files, we can use the <code>rdhs</code> package. This has to be done by first zipping the files to a temporary location, and then using the <code>rdhs::read_flat()</code> function.</p>

<p>Because the different kinds of surveys have different variable structures, we will read each type separately.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll read in a list of file paths, and then map over them to read them in.</p>
<p>In the targets pipeline, we’ve assigned the BR files to a target called <code>dhs_data_BR</code>, which has multiple branches for each file path.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, we should take a look at the actual variable dictionaries for each survey type to plan how we will eventually harmonize and release them (descriptions are provided by ChatGPT and verified with DHS documentation available <a href="https://preview.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG1/Guide_to_DHS_Statistics_DHS-7_v2.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>).</p>

<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/summarize_dhs_flat_dictionary.html">summarize_dhs_flat_dictionary()</a></code> will read in all of the flat files of a given survey type (e.g., BR, HR, IR) and summarize the variable names.</p>

</h3>
<p>Let’s do some simple EDA of the geospatial data to understand what we have.</p>
<p>From the manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In most recent DHS surveys, the groupings of households that participated in the survey, known as clusters, are geo referenced. These survey cluster coordinates are collected in the field using GPS receivers, usually during the survey sample listing process. In general, the GPS readings for most clusters are accurate to less than 15 meters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a DHS cluster is a group of households surveyed at a given location.</p>
<p>We have the following number of years of GPS surveys:</p>

<p>This tells us how many unique clusters (features, in the sf df) we have across each year:</p>

<p>What we want to know: Our healthsheds represent areas of healthcare access. Any analysis that we want to think about should be done with respect to these areas, so that we can know how different variables relate to “healthcare access”.</p>
<p>So, we want to know how many survey clusters fall within each healthshed. To do this, we should do a spatial join between the GPS points and the healthshed polygons, where the goal is to know how many GPS points fall within each healthshed.</p>
<p>At first, this may not look to be very successful because the surveys are relatively sparse:</p>

<p>You may notice that the join created more rows than the original healthsheds. This is because healthsheds are not mutually exclusive (topologically disjoint) and have some overlap:</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is data from many years included, even though the folder is for 1997. From ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The geospatial covariates provided with DHS GPS data (e.g., Annual_Precipitation_2000, Day_Land_Surface_Temp_2010) come from external environmental and remote-sensing datasets, not from the DHS survey itself. The year indicated in each variable name (e.g., _2000, _2005, _2010, _2015) refers to the reference year of the underlying satellite or modeled dataset, not the year when the DHS survey was conducted. These layers are standardized across all DHS surveys so users can compare environmental conditions over time or across countries. For a given survey, analysts typically use covariates from the year closest to the survey year (e.g., use 2000 data for a 1997 survey).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>DHSYEAR = when the survey happened Variable suffix (e.g., _2000) = when the environmental data were measured</p>
<p>Even when two DHS surveys include covariates with the same reference year (e.g., Annual_Precipitation_2000), the values will differ because each survey’s clusters are unique. The covariate year indicates the year of the environmental dataset, not that the same locations or values are shared across surveys.</p>
<p>To clean this, we’ll also need to acknowledge that NA is represented by -9999. It looks like all of the covariates are numeric except for DHSCLUST, which is the cluster ID.</p>

<p>The DHS harmonization package provides methods to read in flat DHS data files, GPS data files, and GPS covariate files. These functions are used to provide an initial targets pipeline that reads in all of the relevant data for Madagascar DHS surveys.</p>
<p>To get a harmonized dataset, reach out to Tinashe on Github and provide a data request, and we can work on harmonizing the datasets for your use case. The harmonized dataset will be made available through a targets endpoint in the package that you can load into your R session.</p>
