<p>So long as the data has a flat structure, it should be straightforward to load it into R and view it using the <code>rdhs</code> package. The structure is taken from this <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm#CP_JUMP_10334" class="external-link">DHS page</a>.</p>
<pre><code>Example:
To give an example of how distribution files for a survey are organized, the following table shows the available files, along with the names that they are given for the Kenya 2003 DHS survey.

<p>So, for the generic ones, we know that we have BR (Birth rates), HR (Household), HW (height and weight), IR (individual), KR (kids), PR (household member), and SQ (Service Availability). We also have WI (wealth), CR (couples), MR (men’s), GE (Geographic Data), GC (geospatial covariates), FW (Fieldworker), and MIS data (malaria response survey).</p>
<p>To read in the generic flat files, we can use the <code>rdhs</code> package. This has to be done by first zipping the files to a temporary location, and then using the <code>rdhs::read_flat()</code> function.</p>

<p>Because the different kinds of surveys have different variable structures, we will read each type separately.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll read in a list of file paths, and then map over them to read them in.</p>
<p>In the targets pipeline, we’ve assigned the BR files to a target called <code>dhs_data_BR</code>, which has multiple branches for each file path.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, we should take a look at the actual variable dictionaries for each survey type to plan how we will eventually harmonize and release them (descriptions are provided by ChatGPT and verified with DHS documentation available <a href="https://preview.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG1/Guide_to_DHS_Statistics_DHS-7_v2.pdf" class="external-link">here</a>).</p>

<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/summarize_dhs_flat_dictionary.html">summarize_dhs_flat_dictionary()</a></code> will read in all of the flat files of a given survey type (e.g., BR, HR, IR) and summarize the variable names.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is data from many years included, even though the folder is for 1997. From ChatGPT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The geospatial covariates provided with DHS GPS data (e.g., Annual_Precipitation_2000, Day_Land_Surface_Temp_2010) come from external environmental and remote-sensing datasets, not from the DHS survey itself. The year indicated in each variable name (e.g., _2000, _2005, _2010, _2015) refers to the reference year of the underlying satellite or modeled dataset, not the year when the DHS survey was conducted. These layers are standardized across all DHS surveys so users can compare environmental conditions over time or across countries. For a given survey, analysts typically use covariates from the year closest to the survey year (e.g., use 2000 data for a 1997 survey).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>DHSYEAR = when the survey happened Variable suffix (e.g., _2000) = when the environmental data were measured</p>
<p>Even when two DHS surveys include covariates with the same reference year (e.g., Annual_Precipitation_2000), the values will differ because each survey’s clusters are unique. The covariate year indicates the year of the environmental dataset, not that the same locations or values are shared across surveys.</p>
<p>To clean this, we’ll also need to acknowledge that NA is represented by -9999. It looks like all of the covariates are numeric except for DHSCLUST, which is the cluster ID.</p>
